        <h1>My name is Declan Ouimet</h1>
        <p>I am taking this class in order to deepen my knowledge and foundation of programming. I hope to become a software engineer in the future after completling my BS in Computer Science at NC State. I am currently working on some personal projects to get better, like a password manager that will be integrated into your browser as an extension.</p>

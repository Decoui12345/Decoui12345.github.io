This is my personal Github account. It is where I will be uploading any projects I might be working on.
This specific repository I just created is for my CTI-110 class. The purpose of doing this is to help get familar with git, github, and some simple file management for projects. It also teaches us about README files in a project and what you can do with them.
To clone this repository locally onto my computer, I first created the repo inside of the github website, named it, and edited any settings I wanted. Then I opened up Github desktop, clicked file at the top right, and then clone a repository. I then chose this repository and decided to store it in the class folder we created from a different assignment.

## Websites I Recommend  
* [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com) - I really like using Quizlet because of it's ability to help me study effectively. It is extremely user friendly and has many different study options. The most common option is using flashcards.
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) - Reddit is very valuable to me aswell because of how easy it is to find answers to unique questions or problems I might have. If there is something very specific going on in my life, whether on a video game or what's the best way to get rid of ants in my backyard, reddit is the best spot to go. It uses markdown style to format the messages and text where users can create different forums to talk about whatever they want. 
* [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com) - Stackoverflow is really good to use if I ever have a problem with my code. It also helps me learn some new concepts in programming. It works by allowing people to create different posts, normally about problems/bugs they are facing, and lets people respond with possible sollutions to it.

This is my personal Github account. It is where I will be uploading any projects I might be working on.
This specific repository I just created is for my CTI-110 class. The purpose of doing this is to help get familar with git, github, and some simple file management for projects. It also teaches us about README files in a project and what you can do with them.
To clone this repository locally onto my computer, I first created the repo inside of the github website, named it, and edited any settings I wanted. Then I opened up Github desktop, clicked file at the top right, and then clone a repository. I then chose this repository and decided to store it in the class folder we created from a different assignment.
